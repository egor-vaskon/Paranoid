# Paranoid

Paranoid aims to provide an easy way of keeping private information both easily and safely. Our approach 
is to completely get rid of sophisticated passwords no one remembers, but instead ask you to complete a short 
quiz each time you access your note. The quiz consists entirely of questions you added beforehand.
