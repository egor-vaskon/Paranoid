# Paranoid

Paranoid is an android app to save your private data(e.g. passwords) using some questions instead of password.

There are a lot of apps to save your private data by setting password,however sometimes you may forget it.
In this case you won't be able to access to your OWN data.It's very irritating.
Actually there is another way. You don't have to remember any sequence of characters,
just answer a few tricky questions  made by yourself before. Paranoid will help you to do it.
